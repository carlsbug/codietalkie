# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an Apple Watch application that enables developers to interact with GitHub repositories through voice commands. The app will authenticate with GitHub, capture voice input from users describing coding tasks, process these requests through an LLM agent, and execute the resulting code changes directly to GitHub repositories. This provides a hands-free coding experience optimized for the Apple Watch interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to authenticate with GitHub on my Apple Watch, so that I can securely access my repositories without typing credentials on the small screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app for the first time THEN the system SHALL display a GitHub authentication flow (this task maybe most user want to do it through synced phone app, so they can type it easily.)
2. WHEN the user completes OAuth authentication THEN the system SHALL securely store the GitHub access token
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL display the main interface
4. IF the stored token expires THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication
5. WHEN the user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all stored authentication data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to select a target GitHub repository through voice or touch, so that I can specify where my code changes should be applied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display a list of accessible repositories
2. WHEN the user taps on a repository THEN the system SHALL set it as the active target
3. WHEN the user speaks "set repository [repo name]" THEN the system SHALL search and set the matching repository
4. WHEN a repository is selected THEN the system SHALL display the repository name in the interface
5. IF no repository is selected THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to choose one before accepting voice commands

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to speak my coding requests to the Apple Watch, so that I can describe what I want to implement without typing on the small screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the voice input button THEN the system SHALL start recording audio
2. WHEN the user is speaking THEN the system SHALL display visual feedback indicating active recording
3. WHEN the user stops speaking or taps the button again THEN the system SHALL stop recording
4. WHEN recording stops THEN the system SHALL convert speech to text using Apple's Speech Recognition
5. WHEN speech-to-text conversion completes THEN the system SHALL display the transcribed text for user confirmation
6. IF speech recognition fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my voice requests to be processed by an AI agent, so that natural language descriptions can be converted into actual code implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user confirms their transcribed request THEN the system SHALL send the text to an LLM API
2. WHEN sending the request THEN the system SHALL include repository context and file structure
3. WHEN the LLM processes the request THEN the system SHALL receive structured code changes and file modifications
4. WHEN the LLM response is received THEN the system SHALL parse the suggested changes
5. IF the LLM request fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry
6. WHEN the response is parsed THEN the system SHALL display a summary of proposed changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to review and approve code changes before they are committed, so that I maintain control over what gets pushed to my repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are proposed THEN the system SHALL display a summary of files to be modified
2. WHEN the user taps on a file summary THEN the system SHALL show a preview of the changes
3. WHEN reviewing changes THEN the system SHALL provide approve and reject options
4. WHEN the user approves changes THEN the system SHALL proceed with GitHub commit
5. WHEN the user rejects changes THEN the system SHALL return to the voice input interface
6. IF changes are too large for watch display THEN the system SHALL show a truncated preview with file count

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want approved code changes to be automatically committed and pushed to GitHub, so that my voice requests result in actual repository updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user approves changes THEN the system SHALL create a new branch or commit to existing branch
2. WHEN committing THEN the system SHALL use an auto-generated commit message based on the voice request
3. WHEN the commit is created THEN the system SHALL push changes to the remote repository
4. WHEN the push completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display a success confirmation
5. IF the push fails THEN the system SHALL display the error message and offer retry options
6. WHEN the operation completes THEN the system SHALL return to the main interface ready for the next request

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the status of my requests and recent activity, so that I can track what changes have been made through the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app THEN the system SHALL display the last 5 recent activities
2. WHEN a request is processing THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator
3. WHEN an operation completes THEN the system SHALL update the activity log
4. WHEN the user taps on an activity item THEN the system SHALL show details of that operation
5. IF there are no recent activities THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message
6. WHEN activities exceed storage limit THEN the system SHALL remove oldest entries automatically
